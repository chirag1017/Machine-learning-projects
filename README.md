# Machine-learning-projects

This project contains implementations of various machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, decision trees and random forest, PCA, LDA and Kmeans clustering. 
There is also a final project based on classifying movies into different genres from their plot summary extracted from IMDB, using Naive Bayes Classifier using a multinomial model for classification where we achieved an overall 80% test accuracy on a database of 12000 movie records containing 27 different genres
